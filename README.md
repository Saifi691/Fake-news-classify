 ðŸ“Œ Overview

Fake news has become one of the biggest challenges in the digital era.  
This project aims to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using textual data from the headlines and article content.

We use:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text feature extraction  
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier** for classification  
- **Streamlit** for a live, browser-based UI

 ðŸ“Š Dataset

We used the **Fake and Real News Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset).

The dataset contains two CSV files:

| File Name   | Size  | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `Fake.csv`  | ~59 MB | Contains **12,999** fake news articles |
| `True.csv`  | ~51 MB | Contains **12,999** real news articles |

**Columns in each file:**
- `title` â†’ Headline of the news article
- `text` â†’ Full article content
- `subject` â†’ News category (politics, world, etc.)
- `date` â†’ Date published

We label:
- **Fake news** â†’ `label = 0`
- **Real news** â†’ `label = 1`
